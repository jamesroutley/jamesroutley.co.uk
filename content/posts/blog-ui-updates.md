I've just updated by blog UI with a couple of things:

1. Centered the header and date
2. Added a footer to blog posts with a photo and bio. Sidenote - Firefox's
   flexbox developer tools look amazing:

3. Updated the body font to Nanum Myeongjo
4. Reduced the code font size to 14px so the letter size matches the body font
   size

Here's what it looks like:
