## Part 1: vision

- The goal of a startup is to find the right thing to build (that customers will pay for) as quickly as possible
- The Lean Startup is a set of practices for helping entrepreneurs build successful startups
- "A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty"
