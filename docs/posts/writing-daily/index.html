  <p>Over the month of February, I&rsquo;m going to try and write a blog post each day. I&rsquo;m
hoping that this high cadence will have a couple of benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;ll get back into the habit of writing</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll learn to write faster</li>
<li>The act of writing every day will help my focus my thoughts, and I&rsquo;ll end up
having ideas or insights I wouldn&rsquo;t have had otherwise</li>
</ol>

<p>I expect the format of my posts to change, to become shorter and less fleshed
out, but I think that&rsquo;s fine for now.</p>

<p>This is my first post of the month - I&rsquo;ve decided to be explicit about what I&rsquo;m
trying to do to add a bit of accountability. I&rsquo;ll check back in with how things
are going though the month.</p>
