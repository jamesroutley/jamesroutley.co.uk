## Notes on salads

## Chicken liver pate

This needs to be made ahead, making it a good starter for a dinner party. 
Pates need fat in them for the texture, duck and geese store fat in their
livers. Chickens don't so we can add in butter ourselves.

- 400g chicken livers
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic
- 250g butter
- sage
- salt + pepper

Slowly fry shallots and garlic for 10 mins. Turn heat up, add livers and sage
and brown them. They should be still pink inside. Blend with 150g softened
butter. Transfer to serving dish. Clarify the rest of the butter by heating it
till it splits. Pour the clear liquid onto the pate. Discard the milk solids.
Press a sage leaf into the butter to make it look nice and chill until ready
to serve.

Serve with sourdough, seasalt and honey.

## Puff-pastry tarts

These are easy to put together for starters/side dishes.

- 1 roll puff pastry

Roll pastry out, score it 1cm from the edge. Add topping and bake at 180C for
20-30 mins

## Chicory, stilton and walnut salad

- 1 head chicory per person

- stilton
