      <title>Thoughts on a scheduling todo list</title>

      <description>Some issues with todo lists Todo lists store a number of tasks, but don&amp;rsquo;t offer any advice on which order to tackle the tasks in. This system works well - it&amp;rsquo;s simple, and people are generally pretty good at quickly working out what to work on next. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a couple of issues with the system:
 When there are lots of tasks, working out the next task can be complicated.</description>

      <description>Over the month of February, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and write a blog post each day. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this high cadence will have a couple of benefits:
 I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into the habit of writing I&amp;rsquo;ll learn to write faster The act of writing every day will help my focus my thoughts, and I&amp;rsquo;ll end up having ideas or insights I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had otherwise  I expect the format of my posts to change, to become shorter and less fleshed out, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s fine for now.</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m building an ls clone. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty similar to the last post&amp;rsquo;s pwd clone. It&amp;rsquo;s called rls.
Code usestd::env;usestd::fs;usestd::process;fn main(){letargs: Vec&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;=env::args().collect();ifargs.len()!=2{usage();}letdirectory=&amp;amp;args[1];letpaths=fs::read_dir(directory).unwrap();forpathinpaths{letpath_buf=path.unwrap().path();letfile_name=path_buf.file_name().unwrap();println!(&amp;#34;{}&amp;#34;,file_name.to_string_lossy())}}fn usage(){eprintln!(&amp;#34;usage: rls &amp;lt;dir&amp;gt;&amp;#34;);process::exit(1);} Fetching arguments We can get the arguments passed to rls with the env::args function, which returns an iterator. We can convert the iterator to a vector, Rust&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;contiguous growable array type&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Over summer, I attended the Recurse Center. I noticed that around half the people in my batch were using Vim, and figured it would be a good time to try it out. I ran into two difficulties:
 I knew the basics of using Vim but I was less efficient than with my previous editor, Visual Studio Code I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to configure Vim to use the syntax highlighting, indentation and linters I was used to.</description>

      <description>The Pico-8 is a &amp;lsquo;fantasy console&amp;rsquo; built by Lexaloffle. It&amp;rsquo;s a program that runs on your computer that lets you write an play small games written in Lua. I recently implemented Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life for Pico-8 and it was a fun and rewarding experience. You can play with my implementation here.
This post contains some thoughts I had while making the game.

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the engineering practice of keeping a logbook, and show how it can be applied to programming work.
Logbooks I studied engineering at university. Part of my course involved practical work, which we recorded in a logbook. To use a logbook successfully, you have to:
 Consider the problem you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to solve Describe your method for solving it Describe the process of carrying out the method Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved  This process is well suited to problem solving and active learning, and is described by George PÃ³lya in his book How to Solve It, which describes a method for solving mathematical problems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing Golang in production at Monzo for a couple of months now. This post shares some things I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about testing Go code.
Parallelisation Golang tests can be easily parallelised by calling t.Parallel() at the beginning of a test:
func TestThing(t *testing.T) { t.Parallel() // test code } This test will now be run in parallel with other tests marked as parallel. Parallel tests are run in a number of goroutines.</description>

      <description>This week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Elm. While at the Recurse Center, I came across the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. The book&amp;rsquo;s concept appealed to me. While I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s possible to learn a programming language in a week, I think there&amp;rsquo;s value in broadening your horizons with the quick study of a wide range of concepts.
This post summarises my initial thoughts about Elm, and lists some resources which may help you learn it.</description>

      <description>This post explores an elegant method for implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors.
Problem We wish to implement functionality that allows the user of a text editor to undo their last action. If they accidentally undo an action, we want to let them redo it.
For the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that a text editor makes edits to a text object. This text object is an array of string pointers1, with each string representing a line of text2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been writing a text editor. One of the first problems I faced was deciding how to store the contents of the file being edited. This post looks at gap buffers, the data structure I ended up using.
Problem We wish to find a data structure which supports the following operations:
 Insert or delete a character at column x, row y Insert or delete the column x  A naive solution: array of strings The simplest way to represent text is with an array of strings.</description>

      <guid>http://routley.io/posts/analyse-test-c-with-python/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been implementing data structures in C. Writing C is fun and educational, because it&amp;rsquo;s lower level than most other common languages. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, and writing it teaches you to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening at a machine level.
However, C is also relatively difficult to write, making it harder to analyse and test. It would be helpful to be able to do this with a higher level language, such as Python.</description>

      <description>Parameterisation is a technique which makes testing simpler, more concise and more effective. It does this by separating test logic from test data. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a test for a simple function, and how it can be improved by parameterisation.
Simple test Let&amp;rsquo;s test the following function:
# prime.py import math def is_prime(x): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; is_prime returns True or False indicating whether x is prime or not. &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; if x &amp;lt;= 1: return False for i in range(2, int(math.</description>

      <title>PSA: cp -r behaves differently on linux and macOS</title>

      <guid>http://routley.io/posts/psa-cp-recursive/</guid>
      <description>Today I found out (the hard way) that the GNU (available on linux) and BSD (available on macOS) implementations of cp behave differently when used to recursively copy.
The differing behaviour comes when running cp with the -r flag on a source directory that ends with a slash (/):
 GNU/linux: copy the whole directory BSD/macOS: copy the contents of the directory  While this is documented behaviour (see man pages below), it can lead to unwanted behaviour if you develop on a mac and build on a linux-based CI system.</description>

      <guid>http://routley.io/posts/golang-test-fixtures/</guid>
      <description>When testing code, test functions may depend on some external dependency. For example, if we have written a:
 Web crawler, we may want to test it on a real website Web server, we may want to test GET methods against a real database  Test fixtures are functions which launch the external dependencies our test code requires.
Say we&amp;rsquo;re writing a web crawler and want to test it against a real website.</description>

A good way of learning this is to play an attacker and to try to break into insecure systems1. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through Natas, a &amp;lsquo;wargame&amp;rsquo; developed by Over The Wire. Natas is a series of insecure webapps, which aim to teach the basics of web security.

      <description>At the Recurse Center, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my way through The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) book. It&amp;rsquo;s an introductory programming book written for an MIT course in 1985. It teaches programming using the language Scheme, a LISP dialect. Scheme is functional, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying learning new functional concepts.
This article aims to explain tail recursion to programmers without experience in functional languages or concepts.
Before looking at tail recursion, let&amp;rsquo;s look at recursion in an imperative language, Python.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started at the Recurse Center (RC), a self-directed, three-month coding program based in New York. The main objective of the course is to improve as a programmer, but the way that&amp;rsquo;s gone about is left up to the individual. Having the opportunity to build anything for an extended period of time in an encouraging and nurturing environment is a privillage offered to few, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to make the most of it.</description>

      <description>Old Website The old website&amp;rsquo;s CSS was based on Bootstrap, with some custom styling. Source code can be found here. The code itself was hacked together.
The font is Josefin Slab, which I quite liked for the main page, but I thought it felt too affected for use as the main font for blog posts.
There are issues with the font size of the monospace font used for code blocks.</description>
