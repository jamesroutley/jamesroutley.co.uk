# Preparations

## Chicken stock (brown)

- 1 chicken carcas and offcuts
- 1.5l water
- 2 carrots split lenghways
- 1 onion, skin on
- 2 celery stems
- Whatever wilting vegetables you have

Roast carcas and offcuts at 220C for 30 mins. Add chicken to the rest of
ingredients and simmer for 2h.

## Gravy

Gravy makes use of the *fond* left over from roasting meat. Pour most of the
fat off the roasting tin, add a tablespoon of plain flour and stir it into
the fat. Slowly add 500ml stock, stiring constantly to stop lumps forming.
I always forget to add it slowly. If you do you can whisk them in, try and
incorporate them with a hand blender or sieve them out, depending on how
you're feeling.

Side note: if you have a liquid you want to thicken with flour you can use
beurre monte - mash butter and flour together with a fork and whisk that mix 
in. The fat helps dispersion and reduces lumps.

##Â Salsa verde

Essential ingredients:
- 1 bunch parsley
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- olive oil
- 3 tbsp wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp capers
- 6 anchovy fillets
- salt + pepper

Optional ingredients:
- small handful of pitted olives
- grated hardboiled egg
- cubed toasted bread

Prepare with a knife and chopping board. Finely chop solid ingredients. 
Roughly pick parsley leaves and chop them too. Add chopped ingredients to
a bowl, add vinegar. Add enough oil to give it a spoonable texture, around 6
tbsp.

## Viniagrette

Essential:
- 1 tbsp wine or cider vinegar
- 3 tbsp olive oil

Fun extras:
- 1 tsp mustard
- 1 tsp honey

Mix all ingredients. Viniagrette is an unstable emulsion and will split. 
Re-whisk it before use. Don't dress salad too early as it wilts leaves. 
Scale as needed.
