# Projects

## Curing: Bacon

- 1kg pork belly, skin and boneless
- 20g salt
- 20g sugar
- spices (up to you, I like lots of fennel seed, black pepper, bay)

Mix up the cure. Sprinkle cure over the pork, place in a large ziplock with
any remaining cure. Cure for 5 days, pouring off any liquid that accumulates.

Rinse off existing cure, let dry uncovered in the fridge.

## Making cheese: Labneh

Mix 1 tsp salt into 500ml greek yoghurt. Put mix in a sieve over a deep bowl
and rest at room temp for 12-24h. Bowl should be deep enough that the drained
liquid doesn't touch the yoghurt mixture.

Serve this in the fridge and use it as you would soft goats cheese. 
Alternatively, roll it into little balls and store under olive oil.

## Baking: Bread

- 500g strong white bread flour
- 325g water
- 10g salt
- 1/2 tsp yeast

Mix ingredients together, let rest for 12-24h at room temp. Form into a loaf
shape and rest on a baking sheet for 2h. Heat an oven to 250C fan, and heat
a cast iron pan with a lid. When hot, put the loaf into the pan, cover with 
the lid and bake for 40 mins, removing the lid after 20 mins.

Variations:

- Focaccia: make dough as before. Add 2 tbsp olive oil to a large baking tray.
    Spread dough out on tray. Rest for 2h. cover with 2 tbsp olive oil,
    press divets into it, top with sea salt, rosemary and thyme.
