================

An adaptation of J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt's Bang Bang Ji Si. The chicken is smoked over rice and black tea. To smoke the chicken, a simple hot smoker is improvised. An existing hot smoker set up could be used, but do not smoke with wood chip, as the imparted flavour will be too strong.

Serves 4 as a salad

Chicken:
- 2 chicken breasts
- 4 tbsp rice
- 4 tbsp black tea
- 3 tbsp brown sugar

Dressing:
- 2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp Chinese sesame paste
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Chinkiang vinegar
- 2 tbsp Sichuanese chilli oil

To serve:
- spring onions
- black and white sesame seeds

Sichuanese chili oil:
- 250ml sunflower oil
- 50g ground Sichuanese chillies or gochugaru (Korean ground chilli)
- 1 tsp sesame seeds
- 1/2 inch piece of unpeeled ginger, crushed with the blade of a knife


Lightly salt the chicken breasts all over, rest for 10 mins. This seasons them, but more importantly forms a pellicle, which allows the smoke to adhere to the meat.

Line the base of a wok with a double layer of tin foil. Place smoking ingredients on top of tin foil. The chicken must now be suspended above the smoking ingredients. This can be done using a suitably sized wire rack, a metal steamer, or a second double later of tin foil, folded over the sides of the wok such that there's a couple of cm clearance. If using tin foil, poke holes in it to allow smoke to permeate through.

Lightly oil the chicken breasts to stop them sitcking, and place on the smoker. Heat the smoker on the stove at the lowest setting. The heat will generate smoke and cook the chicken. Smoke for 30-40 mins, until the chicken is cooked through.

Toast the Sichuan peppercorns for a few minutes in a dry pan over a medium heat, stirring often. Crush in a pestle and mortar. Add garlic and sugar, work into a paste. Transfer to a bowl, add sesame paste, soy, vinegar and chilli oil and stir to combine.

Cut spring onions at a very sharp angle to get 5cm slices. Bathe in ice water to make them curl.

Once the chicken is cooked, let rest until cool, then pull the flesh into thin 5cm strips. Mix chicken with dressing, plate. Top with the spring onions, and sprinkle with black and white sesame seeds.
