<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (RC), a
self-directed, three-month coding program based in New York. The main objective
of the course is to improve as a programmer, but the way that&rsquo;s gone about is
left up to the individual. Having the opportunity to build anything for an
extended period of time in an encouraging and nurturing environment is a
privillage offered to few, and it&rsquo;s important to make the most of it.</p>

<h2 id="planning-time">Planning time</h2>

<p>When considering how best to organise time, it&rsquo;s useful to think of RC&rsquo;s unique
offerings. RC offers a space to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>deeply on a few subjects</li>
<li>broadly on many projects</li>
<li>collaboratively, by pair-programming with other students</li>
<li>individually, but with the ability to draw on the experience of fellow
students, allowing you to tackle harder problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these offerings are mutually exclusive. Talking to RC alumni, I&rsquo;ve met
people who are deeply focused on one or two &lsquo;solo&rsquo; projects, and others who
collaborate, follow their curiosity, and work on many topics. All ways seem
valid, and people change their methodology throughout their time at RC.</p>

<h2 id="my-plan">My plan</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try and work alone on a few long-term projects, interspersed
with multiple, quick (2-3 day), collaborative projects. I&rsquo;m relatively early in
my development as a computer scientist, and at this point I feel I have lots of
unknown unknowns. I think a broad approach will expose me to lots of ideas and
allow me to work out which areas I&rsquo;m most interested in.</p>

<p>Long term projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work through the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
<li>Work on Sceptre</li>
<li>Implement common algorithms and data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas for quick collaborative projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish the interpreter I started</li>
<li>Build a pico-8 game</li>
<li>An embedded Arduino project</li>
<li>Learn about operating systems at a high level</li>
<li>Implement Forth</li>
<li>Study lambda calculus</li>
<li>Study discrete maths</li>
<li>Implement a simple dockerised CI/CD system</li>
<li>Write a text editor</li>
</ul>
