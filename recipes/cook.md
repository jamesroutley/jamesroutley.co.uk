# A collection of recipes for Jonathan

This book contains a collection of recipes to try. Where possible, they are written in a generic way, with notes on how to alter and extend the recipe.

## Starters

### Beetroots and smoked mackerel

### Turkish red lentil soup

### Notes on salads



### Chicken liver pate

This needs to be made ahead, making it a good starter for a dinner party. 
Pates need fat in them for the texture, duck and geese store fat in their
livers. Chickens don't so we can add in butter ourselves.

- 400g chicken livers
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic
- 250g butter
- sage
- salt + pepper

Slowly fry shallots and garlic for 10 mins. Turn heat up, add livers and sage
and brown them. They should be still pink inside. Blend with 150g softened
butter. Transfer to serving dish. Clarify the rest of the butter by heating it
till it splits. Pour the clear liquid onto the pate. Discard the milk solids.
Press a sage leaf into the butter to make it look nice and chill until ready
to serve.

Serve with sourdough, seasalt and honey.

### Puff-pastry tarts

These are easy to put together for starters/side dishes.

- 1 roll puff pastry

Toppings:

- halved cherry tomatoes mixed with olive oil, rosemary, goats cheese
- caramelised onions with olives and anchovies
- cooked mushrooms with thyme, garlic and ricotta

Roll pastry out, score it 1cm from the edge. Add topping and bake at 180C for
20-30 mins

### Chicory, stilton and walnut salad

- 1 head chicory per person
- walnuts
- stilton

Wash chicory and separate leaves. 

## Main courses

### Roast chicken

### Notes on pasta

- Cook pasta for 1 minute less than the package instruction
- Cook pasta in water salted with 1 tbsp salt per litre of water
- Use less water than you expect
- Pasta cooking water is starchy. A couple of tbsp of this water should be
    mixed into the sauce as it helps it to emulsify.

### Cooked vegetables

Some ideas:

- Roast vegetables at 220C for either 20 mins or 40 mins depending on how
    hardy they are
- Wilted spring greens with garlic, anchovies and butter are a great, neutral
    addition to lots of meals
- Onions and leeks are both cheap and good for bulking out dishes with stewed
    meat without becoming overpowering.

### Beef cheek stew

### Ideas for a crab

Kill, cook and pick a crab. Find a youtube video to teach you how to do this,
it's easiest to learn by watching. When picked, you should have a bowl of
white meat and a bowl of brown meat. White meat has nice texture, brown meat
has nice flavour. Crab meat frezes well so it can be fun to cook a couple at
a time and freeze the meat for later use.

- Make crab and nduja linguine when you're trying to impress someone
    but don't want them to think you're trying to impress them. 100g linguine
    per person, 
- Add crab meat to fried rice, season it with fish sauce
- Serve unshelled crab with sourdough and mayonaise and a salad
- Crab with rosti
- Crab scrambled eggs

This is a really thing to cook if you've pre-picked a crab because it
comes together quickly and it's delicious.

- brown and white crab meat
- 1/2 tbsp nduja per person
- 100g linguine per person
- parsley
- juice and zest of a lemon

### Slow-roasted lamb shoulder

- 1kg lamb shoulder on the bone
- 700g onions, sliced (use a food processor for this)
- small tin of anchovies
- bulb of garlic, peeled
- rosemary and thyme

Season and brown the shoulder all over. Remove lamb from pan, add the onions
and cook them down for a couple of mins. Add the anchovies, garlic and herbs.
Return lamb to pan, cover and roast for 4 hours at 140C.

## Deserts

### Sponge cake

### Pear and chocolate cake

## Projects

### Curing bacon

- 1kg pork belly, skin and boneless
- 20g salt
- 20g sugar
- spices (up to you, I like lots of fennel seed, black pepper, bay)

Mix up the cure. Sprinkle cure over the pork, place in a large ziplock with
any remaining cure. Cure for 5 days, pouring off any liquid that accumulates.

Rinse off existing cure, let dry uncovered in the fridge.

### Labneh

Mix 1tsp salt into 500ml greek yoghurt. Put mix in a sieve over a deep bowl
and rest at room temp for 12-24h. Bowl should be deep enough that the drained
liquid doesn't touch the yoghurt mixture.

Serve this in the fridge and use it as you would soft goats cheese. 
Alternatively, roll it into little balls and store under olive oil.

### Bread

## Sauces and stocks

### Chicken stock (brown)

- 1 chicken carcas and offcuts
- 1.5l water
- 2 carrots split lenghways
- 1 onion, skin on
- 2 celery stems
- Whatever wilting vegetables you have

Roast carcas and offcuts at 220C for 30 mins. Add chicken to the rest of
ingredients and simmer for 2h.

### Gravy

Gravy makes use of the *fond* left over from roasting meat. Pour most of the
fat off the roasting tin, add a tablespoon of plain flour and stir it into
the fat. Slowly add 500ml stock, stiring constantly to stop lumps forming.
I always forget to add it slowly. If you do you can whisk them in, try and
incorporate them with a hand blender or sieve them out, depending on how
you're feeling.

Side note: if you have a liquid you want to thicken with flour you can use
beurre monte - mash butter and flour together with a fork and whisk that mix 
in. The fat helps dispersion and reduces lumps.

### Salsa verde

Essential ingredients:
- 1 bunch parsley
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- olive oil
- 3 tbsp wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp capers
- 6 anchovy fillets
- salt + pepper

Optional ingredients:
- small handful of pitted olives
- grated hardboiled egg
- cubed toasted bread

Prepare with a knife and chopping board. Finely chop solid ingredients. 
Roughly pick parsley leaves and chop them too. Add chopped ingredients to
a bowl, add vinegar. Add enough oil to give it a spoonable texture, around 6
tbsp.

### Viniagrette

Essential:
- 1 tbsp wine or cider vinegar
- 3 tbsp olive oil

Fun extras:
- 1 tsp mustard
- 1 tsp honey

Mix all ingredients. Viniagrette is an unstable emulsion and will split. 
Re-whisk it before use. Don't dress salad too early as it wilts leaves. 
Scale as needed.
