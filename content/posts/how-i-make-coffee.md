_This post covers how I currently make coffee at home. I'll update it if
anything changes_

## Aeropress

Equipment:

- Porlex hand grinder (I have the 'tall' version)
- Aeropress
- Weighing scale
- Timer

Technique:

1. Grind 15g coffee to a medium grind (7-8 'clicks' from closed on the Porlex)
2. Insert the Aeropress plunger into the main body, to the '4' mark. Place the
   Aeropress upside down onto a weighing scale, so the end of the plunger is on
   the scale, and the open end of the main body is facing up
3. Place the filter paper into the lid of the Aeropress, and wash it through
   with water, boil about 400g of water
4. Add the coffee to the Aeropress, tare the scale,
5. Add 200g of water just off the boil, start the timer, add the rest of the
   water to your cup to heat it up
6. After about 20 seconds, a crust of coffee grounds will form at the top of the
   Aeropress. Stir this back into the coffee
7. After 60 seconds, fit the top onto the Aeropress, invert onto your (emptied)
   cup and slowly press it. You're not pressing hard, mostly using the weight of
   your arms. It'll take ~20 seconds to press. Stop when you start to hear the
   hissing sound of air passing through the filter
