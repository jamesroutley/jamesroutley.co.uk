<p>Over summer, I attended the Recurse Center. I noticed that around half the
people in my batch were using Vim, and figured it would be a good time to try it
out. I ran into two difficulties:</p>

<ol>
<li>I knew the basics of using Vim but I was less efficient than with my previous
editor, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t know how to configure Vim to use the syntax highlighting,
indentation and linters I was used to. I was trying out lots of different
programming languages, and needed to set Vim up for each one separately.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to deal with these problems separately. I focused on the former by
using a preconfigured Vim setup to defer having to think about the  latter.</p>

<h2 id="initial-vim-configuration">Initial Vim configuration</h2>

<p>I installed Amir Salihefendic&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc">vimrc</a>. It
provided a really good starting point, and I&rsquo;d recommend it to people who don&rsquo;t
want to roll their own config.</p>

<p>Once I felt productive at using Vim, I decided to write my own Vim
configuration. This let me address some minor issues I had:
- I found it difficult to understand which features were and built into
    Vim, and which came from the <code>vimrc</code>
- The <code>vimrc</code> contained features I didn&rsquo;t use
- The <code>vimrc</code> vendored packages into the repo. To add new things, I needed to
    use git submodules, a lower level of abstraction than I wanted to use
- I forked the repo to make some changes. Maintaining the fork and keeping
    everything up to date was a lot of effort</p>

<h2 id="current-vim-configuration">Current Vim configuration</h2>

<p>I wanted a configuration that was:
- Language agnostic and supported a wide range of languages
- Minimal and close to native Vim where possible
- Easy to edit and used a modern package manager</p>

<p>You can see my full configuration on
<a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/nvim/blob/master/init.vim">GitHub</a>. It&rsquo;s just
over 100 lines of code, including comments and newlines.</p>

<h3 id="file-navigation">File navigation</h3>

<p>I use Tim Pope&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar">vim-vinegar</a> to interact
with the filesystem and open files. It&rsquo;s a thin wrapper around Vim&rsquo;s built in
<code>netrw</code>. When editing a file, pressing <code>-</code> opens a listing of that file&rsquo;s parent
directory. Pressing <code>-</code> again to moves you up a directory. To find a particular
directory or file, I use the normal Vim search (<code>/</code>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard good things about fuzzy finders such as
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf</a>, but haven&rsquo;t used them myself.</p>

<h3 id="splits-and-tabs">Splits and tabs</h3>

<p>I use both tabs and splits to edit multiple files. At work I mostly code on a
large number of microservices written in Go. I&rsquo;ll use one tab per service, and
two or three splits per tab.</p>

<p>To open splits, I&rsquo;ve mapped <code>=</code> to open the current file in a vertical split. I
use this in conjunction with <code>vim-vinegar</code>&rsquo;s <code>-</code> command to quickly open files
from the same package/directory in a new split.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t currently interact with the open buffer list directly.</p>

<p>To move between splits, I&rsquo;ve added the mappings <code>ctrl+&lt;h/j/k/l&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">&#34; Easy split navigation</span><span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>map &lt;C-j&gt; &lt;C-w&gt;j<span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>map &lt;C-k&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;k<span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>map &lt;C-h&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;h<span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>map &lt;C-l&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;l</code></pre></div>
<p>To create new tabs I use <code>T</code>, and to switch between them, I use <code>alt+&lt;h/l&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">&#34; Simplify using tabs</span><span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>nnoremap ˙ gT<span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>nnoremap ¬ gt<span style="">
</span><span style=""></span>nnoremap T :tabnew&lt;cr&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="language-support">Language support</h3>

<p>I use two plugins to get decent Vim support for most languages I&rsquo;ll ever use:
- <a href="https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot">vim-polyglot</a>: Syntax highlighting
    and correct indenting
- <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">Asynchronous Line Engine (ALE)</a>: Linting</p>

<h3 id="interacting-with-code">Interacting with code</h3>

<p>I use a couple of small plugins which make writing code marginally easier. The
features they implement come built into Visual Studio Code:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">vim-commentary</a>: Comment out lines or
blocks of code. It works for most languages I&rsquo;ve tried</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs">auto-pairs</a>: When you type a left
parenthesis, it automatically types a right parenthesis and moves your
cursor between the two</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter">vim-gitgutter</a>: Display a green
<code>+</code> or a red <code>-</code> next to columns that have been edited in a file</li>
<li><code>:set colorcolumn = 80</code>: Display a faint line at 80 chars</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="package-management">Package management</h3>

<p>I use Junegunn Choi&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> as my
package manager. I like its simple API (add GitHub repos, run <code>PlugInstall</code>). It
operates at a higher level of abstraction than
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> or Vim 8&rsquo;s native package
loading in that you don&rsquo;t interact with your plugins&rsquo; files directly. This feels
familiar if you&rsquo;re used to brew/apt-get/pip etc.</p>

<h3 id="logbook">Logbook</h3>

<p>To simplify writing my
<a href="https://routley.io/tech/2017/11/23/logbook.html">logbook</a>, I wrote a Vim
plugin, <a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/vim-logbook">vim-logbook</a> which lets me
easily open today&rsquo;s logbook and add timestamps.</p>
