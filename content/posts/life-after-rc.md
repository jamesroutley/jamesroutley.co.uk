title: Life after the Recurse Center
---

My batch at the Recurse Center finished last week. This seems like an
appropriate moment to reflect on what I've learnt, and what I want to prioritise
over the coming months.

## Past three months

### Technical

I learnt:

- How programming languages work
- C
- x86 Assembly
- JavaScript
- Scheme
- Forth
- Principles of web security
- P5.js
- Algorithms + data structures
- A large amount of 'osmosis' knowledge from being around so many talented
  people

I wrote:

- A Lisp interpreter
- A Forth interptreter
- A chrome extension
- A web game
- Blog posts
- Solutions to the first couple of chapters of SICP
- A ray tracer
- Sceptre features

### Non-technical

- Met a brilliant community of amazing people
- Spent summer in NYC
- Travelled to fun places: New York, San Francisco, Boston, Montreal, Napa,
  Virginia Beach
- Started reading more often

## Next three months

### Technical

- Monzo. I'm starting a new job as a backend developer at
  [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) in two weeks. I'll be working with a new
  technology stack (Golang microservices on Kubernetes - how _de rigeur_) and
  industry (banking). I expect to learn a lot over the next couple of months,
  and I'm not worried about planning specifics.
- Scheme compiler. Since learning Golang, I've been interested in the
  convenience of compiled languages. I'm toying with the idea of writing a
  Scheme to Golang transcompiler. It should be an interesting learning
  experience as I've not written a compiler before. Targeting Golang rather than
  something like the LLVM simplifies the task, as Golang natively supports
  Lisp-ey constructs like first class functions. An implementation of something
  similar already [exists](https://github.com/jcla1/gisp), which I can use as my
  spirit guide.
- Haskell. I've been meaning to learn Haskell for a while. Some of my favourite
  elements of Python are borrowed from functional languages and I think it makes
  sense to learn the canonical functional language.
- Keep blogging (roughly) weekly.

### Non-technical

- Alumni checkins. RC has a checkin (similar to Agile stand ups) thread on its
  IM. Checkins are a useful tool for accountability and keeping in touch with
  the community. I didn't regularly write checkins when my batch was running,
  but I hope to do so now.
- Continue reading.
- Exercise regularly.
- Go to more theatre/art.
- Go clubbing more often.

I'm not sure what my Monzo workload will be like. It's possible Scheme or
Haskell won't happen, but I'm alright with this. I think I'll be learning enough
in the first months either way.
