  <p>This February, I&rsquo;m trying to write a blog post every day. I&rsquo;m now a week in -
how are things going?</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m finding it easier coming up with things to write about. I&rsquo;ve started
noting down interesting things I come across through my day as potential blog
posts.</li>
<li>I feel more comfortable writing shorter posts, which has opened up the range
of topics I&rsquo;m happy to write about.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m having fun! It feels good to put thoughts down on paper, and I feel like
I&rsquo;m cultivating my own corner of the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Historically, I wrote longer blog posts on topics I would spend a couple of
days working on. This allowed me to write about things at a deeper level than
I have time to now.</li>
<li>Writing daily takes time, and I&rsquo;ve stopped doing other things I get value from
to do it</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m enjoying writing daily, and intend to continue through to the end
of the month. After that, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll continue, but I&rsquo;m hoping the
experience will make me write more frequently.</p>
