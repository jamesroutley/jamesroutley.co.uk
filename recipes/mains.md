# Main courses

## Roast chicken

Butterfly a chicken. Salt the skin and let rest for 45 mins in the fridge if
you have time. Roast at 240C for 45 mins.

Variations:

- Roast chicken with parboiled potatoes, lemon slices and chorizo
- Roast the chicken with the following spice mix:
    - 1 tsp black pepper
    - 1 tsp sweet paprika
    - 1 tsp smoked paprika
    - 1 tsp fennel seed, toasted and ground
    - 1 tsp chilli flakes

## Notes on pasta

- Cook pasta for 1 minute less than the package instruction
- Cook pasta in water salted with 1 tbsp salt per litre of water
- Use less water than you expect
- Pasta cooking water is starchy. A couple of tbsp of this water should be
    mixed into the sauce as it helps it to emulsify.

Ideas:

- Mushrooms with garlic, creme fraiche and thyme
- Grated courgette, red chilli, parmesan
- Spring greens, tinned mackerel, capers, lemon
- Crab, nduja, parsley, lemon

## Cooked vegetables

Some ideas:

- Roast vegetables at 220C for either 20 mins or 40 mins depending on how
    hardy they are
- Wilted spring greens with garlic, anchovies and butter are a great, neutral
    addition to lots of meals
- Onions and leeks are both cheap and good for bulking out dishes with stewed
    meat without becoming overpowering.

## Slow roasted lamb shoulder

- 1kg lamb shoulder on the bone
- 700g onions, sliced (use a food processor for this)
- small tin of anchovies
- bulb of garlic, peeled
- rosemary and thyme

Season and brown the shoulder all over. Remove lamb from pan, add the onions
and cook them down for a couple of mins. Add the anchovies, garlic and herbs.
Return lamb to pan, cover and roast for 4 hours at 140C.

## Ideas for a crab

Kill, cook and pick a crab. Find a youtube video to teach you how to do this,
it's easiest to learn by watching. When picked, you should have a bowl of
white meat and a bowl of brown meat. White meat has nice texture, brown meat
has nice flavour. Crab meat frezes well so it can be fun to cook a couple at
a time and freeze the meat for later use.

- Add crab meat to fried rice, season it with fish sauce
- Serve unshelled crab with sourdough and mayonaise and a salad
- Crab with rosti
- Crab scrambled eggs
