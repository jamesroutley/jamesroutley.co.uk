<p>My batch at the Recurse Center finished last week. This seems like an
appropriate moment to reflect on what I&rsquo;ve learnt, and what I want to prioritise
over the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="past-three-months">Past three months</h2>

<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>

<p>I learnt:</p>

<ul>
<li>How programming languages work</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>x86 Assembly</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>Forth</li>
<li>Principles of web security</li>
<li>P5.js</li>
<li>Algorithms + data structures</li>
<li>A large amount of &lsquo;osmosis&rsquo; knowledge from being around so many talented
people</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Lisp interpreter</li>
<li>A Forth interptreter</li>
<li>A chrome extension</li>
<li>A web game</li>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>Solutions to the first couple of chapters of SICP</li>
<li>A ray tracer</li>
<li>Sceptre features</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-technical">Non-technical</h3>

<ul>
<li>Met a brilliant community of amazing people</li>
<li>Spent summer in NYC</li>
<li>Travelled to fun places: New York, San Francisco, Boston, Montreal, Napa,
Virginia Beach</li>
<li>Started reading more often</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-three-months">Next three months</h2>

<h3 id="technical-1">Technical</h3>

<ul>
<li>Monzo. I&rsquo;m starting a new job as a backend developer at
<a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a> in two weeks. I&rsquo;ll be working with a new
technology stack (Golang microservices on Kubernetes - how <em>de rigeur</em>) and
industry (banking). I expect to learn a lot over the next couple of months,
and I&rsquo;m not worried about planning specifics.</li>
<li>Scheme compiler. Since learning Golang, I&rsquo;ve been interested in the
convenience of compiled languages. I&rsquo;m toying with the idea of writing a
Scheme to Golang transcompiler. It should be an interesting learning
experience as I&rsquo;ve not written a compiler before. Targeting Golang rather than
something like the LLVM simplifies the task, as Golang natively supports
Lisp-ey constructs like first class functions. An implementation of something
similar already <a href="https://github.com/jcla1/gisp">exists</a>, which I can use as my
spirit guide.</li>
<li>Haskell. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to learn Haskell for a while. Some of my favourite
elements of Python are borrowed from functional languages and I think it makes
sense to learn the canonical functional language.</li>
<li>Keep blogging (roughly) weekly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-technical-1">Non-technical</h3>

<ul>
<li>Alumni checkins. RC has a checkin (similar to Agile stand ups) thread on its
IM. Checkins are a useful tool for accountability and keeping in touch with
the community. I didn&rsquo;t regularly write checkins when my batch was running,
but I hope to do so now.</li>
<li>Continue reading.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Go to more theatre/art.</li>
<li>Go clubbing more often.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what my Monzo workload will be like. It&rsquo;s possible Scheme or
Haskell won&rsquo;t happen, but I&rsquo;m alright with this. I think I&rsquo;ll be learning enough
in the first months either way.</p>
