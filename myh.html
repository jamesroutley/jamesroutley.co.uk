  <h1>Mind Your Head</h1>
  <p>Mind Your Head is an Oxford based organisation aiming to increase awareness about mental health issues. I was asked to rebuild their website and blog, which was previously a poorly designed Wordpress site. Due to the large amount of information which needed to be presented by the site, a multi-page website was decided on, with Tumblr used for the blog.</p>
