<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve been learning Elm. While at the Recurse Center, I came across
the book
<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>.
The book&rsquo;s concept appealed to me. While I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to learn a
programming language in a week, I think there&rsquo;s value in broadening your
horizons with the quick study of a wide range of concepts.</p>

<p>This post summarises my initial thoughts about Elm, and lists some resources
which may help you learn it.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Elm is a front-end language. It compiles to JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a
strongly typed, purely functional language, and it borrows syntax from Haskell.
It has a small <a href="http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax">syntax</a>, and only implements a
few
<a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/">core libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Elm defines the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm Architecture</a>, a
pattern that most applications should follow. This architecture splits code into
three sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>Model - the state of an application</li>
<li>Update - the way to update the state</li>
<li>View - how the state is presented as HTML</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fun to write. Elm aims to be a beginner friendly language. It&rsquo;s accessible,
and seems to have a good community.</li>
<li>Friendly compiler. I think Elm&rsquo;s compiler is the most helpful compiler I&rsquo;ve
used. It offers helpful debugging notes. It also writes in the first person!</li>
<li>Community. Elm&rsquo;s community seems friendly. It&rsquo;s not huge, and there are fewer
stack overflow questions etc than I&rsquo;m used to.</li>
<li>Single ecosystem. Elm is relatively self contained. It&rsquo;s easy to set the
compiler up, without having to configure babel, react, redux, webpack etc.</li>
<li>Architecture. Having a fixed architecture makes it easy to start developing in
Elm. I think more languages should offer example architectures.</li>
<li>Safety. Elm aims to be a safe language. It has a strict type system which if
used well can catch a lot of bugs at compile time. It doesn&rsquo;t have a
<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/maybe.html">concept of null</a>, and
forces the user to account for procedures which
<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/result.html">may fail</a>.</li>
<li>Haskell introduction. Elm shares features with Haskell, but is simpler and
carries less baggage. It may be a useful stepping stone to learning Haskell.</li>
<li>Javascript interop. Interacting with plain JavaScript libraries happens via
<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html">ports or flags</a>. From
what I understand, these allow safe interaction with potentially unsafe
external code. I haven&rsquo;t actually done this so I can&rsquo;t say any more about
this!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html">Elm Guide</a>. I&rsquo;d recommend working
through this to get an overview of how to install, setup and write Elm.</li>
<li><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elm/">Learn Elm in Y Minutes</a>. A useful
guide to Elm&rsquo;s syntax.</li>
<li>elm-repl. Elm&rsquo;s repl is useful for quickly testing ideas out.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/elm-community/elm-test">elm-test</a>. I found writing tests
useful for confirming that functions behave as expected.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design">Let&rsquo;s be mainstream</a>.
A talk by Evan Czaplicki, Elm&rsquo;s inventor, on some of the philosophy behind the
language.</li>
