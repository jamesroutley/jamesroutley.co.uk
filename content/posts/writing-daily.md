Over the month of February, I'm going to try and write a blog post each day. I'm hoping that this high cadence will have a couple of benefits:

1. I'll get back into the habit of writing
2. I'll learn to write faster
3. The act of writing every day will help my focus my thoughts, and I'll end up having ideas or insights I wouldn't have had otherwise

I expect the format of my posts to change, to become shorter and less fleshed out, but I think that's fine for now.

This is my first post of the month - I've decided to be explicit about what I'm trying to do to add a bit of accountability. I'll check back in with how things are going though the month.
