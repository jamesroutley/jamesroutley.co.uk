I learnt to make sourdough using the Tartine book, but recently I've been making
bread with a lower (70%) hydration dough. The lower hydration means you don't
need to do the turns during the bulk fermentation, because you can get away with
less gluten formation. I think (?) you get less oven spring with lower
hydration, so I've compensated by prooving until the dough really doubles in
size, which takes a lot longer at home than the times in Tartine. Tartine
assumes a 25C room temp, which we definitely don't have in Manchester.

- 450g strong white flour
- 50g wholewheat flour
- 100g sourdough starter
- 10g salt
- 350g water

1. Mix everything, till it comes together into a rough ball.
2. Rest for 30 mins, then do a turn. This is just to hydrate any dry bits on the
   top of the dough.
3. Rise until it's doubled in size. The time this takes depends on the ambient
   temperature. I rise bread in an _off_ oven with a pan of boiling water next
   to it for 6-8 hours.
4. Turn it out, and shape it into a boule.
5. Rise in a banneton for 2-4 hours until it's doubled in size.
6. Bake in cast iron for 40 mins at 220C, removing the lid for the last 20 mins.
