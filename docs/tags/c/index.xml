      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been implementing data structures in C. Writing C is fun and educational, because it&amp;rsquo;s lower level than most other common languages. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, and writing it teaches you to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening at a machine level.
However, C is also relatively difficult to write, making it harder to analyse and test. It would be helpful to be able to do this with a higher level language, such as Python.</description>
