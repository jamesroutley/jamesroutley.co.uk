<p>I started writing this blog earlier this year. So far, I&rsquo;ve found it to be a
valuable experience. It encourages me to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for interesting things in the work I do</li>
<li>Deeply understand the topic I&rsquo;m writing about</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post, I cover some of the challenges I face when blogging, and the
techniques I use to get around them.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>I face two main problems when trying to write: perfectionism and difficulty with
correctly scoping posts. I follow a rule which I&rsquo;ve found helps with this:</p>

<p><strong>Write a blog post every week</strong></p>

<p>The hard deadline of publishing each week forces me to keep the scope of what
I&rsquo;m writing about small and encourages me to not worry too much about making it
&lsquo;perfect&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Writing a blog post a week isn&rsquo;t easy. I&rsquo;d recommend finding an external source
of motivation. I have a deal with my partner where I give her Â£5 for every week
I miss a blog post. Aligning my desire to not lose money with writing a blog has
been helpful. There&rsquo;s a Berlin-based group called
<a href="https://ironbloggerberlin.com/about/">Iron Blogger</a> who do something similar.</p>
