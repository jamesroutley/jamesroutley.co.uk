## Equipment

- All-metal boston cocktail shaker
  
  Boston shakers consist of two cups, one large and one small, which fit
  together to form a space in which you shake a drink. Boston shakers are easier
  to use than the more common three-piece shaker. Boston shakers often come as a
  large metal tin and a small glass, but try to find an all-metal one[^1].

  Alternatives: Three piece shakers work, and are often the only thing
  available. I've used a large thermos flask in the past but it's not great.

- Hawthorne strainer. 

  Used to strain ice cubes out of the drink.

  Alternatives: Anything that will stop the ice in the tin from going into the
  glass e.g. a spoon to hold the ice back, a large kitchen sieve, using the
  small tin to create a small opening that the ice can't pass through.

- Small sieve

  Shaking a drink can sometime shatter the ice cubes, producing
  shards small enough to pass through the hawthorne. Some people like these
  shards and leave them. If you don't pour the drink though a small sieve to
  remove them.

  Alternatives: a large kitchen sieve

- Citrus juicer TODO specific type 

  Lots of drinks use citrus juice.

  Alternatives: any other citrus juicer, any other method you can think of for
  getting juice out of a citrus fruit. Rolling the citrus between your palm and
  a table to break the juice cells before cutting it can make this easier.

- Bar spoon. 

  Used to stir drinks and measure out small amounts of ingredients. 
  
  Alternatives: long thin desert spoon, chopstick.

## Ingredients

- Ice: lots can be said about the type of ice you use, but it's out of scope for
  this article. If you're interested, see one of the books I recommend TODO link.

- Simple syrup: dissolve 1 part sugar into 1 part water. I measure my 'parts' by
  weight, which is more accurate and consistent. If you don't have weighing
  scales you can do 1:1 by volume. Dissolving can be done by heating the water
  up, but if you have a blender, it's simpler to blend the water and sugar for a
  bit. This gives your room temperature syrup, ready to use immediately. I've
  found that blending a syrup whips air into it, making it cloudy. This
  cloudiness makes it look like the sugar hasn't disolved, but it has. If you
  let it sit for a couple of minutes the cloudiness will disapate.

## Built drinks

## Shaken drinks

Shaking a drink does several things:

- Melts the ice quicker than a stirred drink, giving a more diluted (lower
  alcohol) drink
- Whips air into the drink, giving it a thing drinks people call 'texture'

To make a shaken drink: 

1. Add the ingredients to the small tin. 
2. Fill the large tin 2/3 full with ice. 
3. Pour the ice into the small tin and place the large tin over the small at an
   angle. 
4. Hit the large tin to seal the tins together.
5. Shake for 12 seconds[^TODO].
