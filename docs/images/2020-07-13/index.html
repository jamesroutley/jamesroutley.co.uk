    <p>I learnt to make sourdough using the Tartine book, but recently I&rsquo;ve been making
bread with a lower (70%) hydration dough. The lower hydration means you don&rsquo;t
need to do the turns during the bulk fermentation, because you can get away with
less gluten formation. I think (?) you get less oven spring with lower
hydration, so I&rsquo;ve compensated by prooving until the dough really doubles in
size, which takes a lot longer at home than the times in Tartine. Tartine
assumes a 25C room temp, which we definitely don&rsquo;t have in Manchester.</p>

<ul>
<li>450g strong white flour</li>
<li>50g wholewheat flour</li>
<li>100g sourdough starter</li>
<li>10g salt</li>
<li>350g water</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Mix everything, till it comes together into a rough ball.</li>
<li>Rest for 30 mins, then do a turn. This is just to hydrate any dry bits on the
top of the dough.</li>
<li>Rise until it&rsquo;s doubled in size. The time this takes depends on the ambient
temperature. I rise bread in an <em>off</em> oven with a pan of boiling water next
to it for 6-8 hours.</li>
<li>Turn it out, and shape it into a boule.</li>
<li>Rise in a banneton for 2-4 hours until it&rsquo;s doubled in size.</li>
<li>Bake in cast iron for 40 mins at 220C, removing the lid for the last 20 mins.</li>
</ol>
